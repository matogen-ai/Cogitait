                In today’s fiercely competitive landscape, where customer
                loyalty is constantly challenged, businesses must connect with
                customers on a deeply personal level. COGIT<span

                >T’s Campaign as a Service empowers loyalty-driven sectors—like
                QSR, retail, and hospitality—to foster this essential
                connection. <br />We conducted a comprehensive segmentation
                exercise, analysing data through two robust models powered by
                our proprietary AI and machine learning tools. The
                <span class="bold-text">Responder Model</span>
                predicts customer purchasing propensity, while the
                <span class="bold-text">Recommender Model</span> targets
                specific customer clusters based on past purchases, delivering
                tailored offers by segment. This model even revives dormant
                customers with enticing value-for-money offers to prevent
                churn.<br />
                Together, these models are powered by a dynamic AI algorithm
                that adjusts in real-time, ensuring every interaction is
                optimized to boost customer loyalty and lifetime value.
