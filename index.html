                     <h3>Marketing using Play</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Play is an innate component of the human experience and from an early age children acquire cognitive and social skills through playing games. The same innate psychological triggers that make games enjoyable have been shown to trigger consumer engagement and retention in the field of marketing.
                        <br><br>
                        “Gamification marketing” is defined as harnessing gaming elements in a non-gaming context as part of marketing campaigns to increase the level of participation and influence consumer behaviour.
                        <br><br>
                        Rewards programmes are a traditional, tried-and-tested type of gamified marketing that is a widely used tool that rewards brand loyalty. Customers earn points by spending more on a particular brand and perks and rewards are allocated based on a tiered system.
                        <br><br>
                        In online language learning, gamification is used to set incremental goals to motivate people in the arduous journey of acquiring a new language. Controversially, online gamified simulations have been used to gauge interest in, and encourage, enlistment in the US military.
                        <br><br>
                        Marketers within the sport and exercise realms have included gamification to unleash consumers’ innate competitiveness while promoting their products and FMCG companies often used contests with entry contingent upon goods purchases.

                     </p>
                     <h4>Spin & Win Analysis</h4>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        A client in the telecoms sector is very active in a consumer sector that is noteworthy for its price-sensitivity, i.e the extent to which the product price affects consumers’ purchasing behaviour. The company had previously embarked on a gamified marketing campaign to foster brand loyalty in this volatile space.
                        <br><br>   
                        Cogitait was contracted to analyse data on three gamified marketing campaigns to establish whether they were successful.
                        <br><br>   
                        Data was analysed for almost 2 million subscribers that played the game during the three campaigns; scrutinising trends and comparisons to subscribers that did not participate in the game. Significant trends and insights were uncovered relating to recharge frequency, additional revenue generated and active days data.
                        <br><br>
                        The Cogitait team was able to pinpoint and quantify the differences between game-playing and non game-playing cohorts, assisting the client in planning future strategic marketing efforts

                     </p>
                     <h3>Debt Collection</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Cogitait helped a large corporate client to improve its debt collection strategy using advanced analytics.
                        <br><br>
                        When creditors struggle to collect overdue payments, it usually signifies the beginning-of-the-end of their relationship with the customer. Apart from improving collection rates on outstanding amounts, Cogitait’ client in the telecoms sector desired stronger customer retention, and subsequently, growth. They joined forces to embark on a programme of intelligent customer insights to manage the customer journey.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Debt collection advanced analytics</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           The Cogitait data science team undertook a comprehensive collections diagnostic, in addition to supporting the client’s collections team with managing the ‘run down’ book. Cogitait harnessed the foundational components, Right Party Contact (RPC), gleaned from advanced data wrangling and modelling, as well as the client insights enriched by alternative data sources and application of  new variables created from Credit Bureau data. Right Party Contact enables the client to get hold of delinquent customers, overcoming the challenges of contactability and network dormancy, whilst the advanced customer analytics made it possible to adjust the service component of the customer’s package downwards to match their current affordability profile.<br><br>
                           This innovative and flexible approach to debt collection analytics simultaneously increases collection, as well as customer retention rates.
                        </p>

                     <h3>Alternative Data Credit Score</h3>   
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Traditionally, when assessing a potential customer’s credit risk, financial services providers have had to rely on information pertaining to the individual’s past credit activities, such as type of credit obtained, and utilisation, generally obtained from credit bureaus. In contrast, “alternative data” is defined as any data not related to a client’s credit activity, yet provides crucial information about their habits, preferences, behavior, and character. It is important that alternative data originates from a source where it cannot be manipulated by the data subject. According to Experian, 65% of lenders already use alternative data to make lending decisions.
                     </p>
                     <h4>Substitute scorecards</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Credit bureau data proved limited for the customers of one of Cogitait’ financial services client, especially in several key portfolios. However, Cogitait was able to build substitute scorecards using “alternative customer data” from other purchasing data accessible within the client’s data warehouse.<br><br>
                           
                        The Cogitait data scientist performed creative indirect matching to compensate for the large number of missing SA ID numbers of clients. In addition, purchasing data was analysed to reveal a plethora of attributes with good predictive strength. Cogitait created a framework using this novel data to generate new descriptive features and predictive models, which delivered additional insights into customers and their behaviour. These substitute scorecards were shown to perform very well compared to those produced by traditional credit bureaus.

                     </p>
                     <h4>Marketing and compliance</h4>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        This alternative data credit scoring framework will be used internally on an ongoing basis to guide decision-making on marketing ethics and strategies to unlock new opportunities. For example, it would mitigate risk to the end-consumer due to over-indebtedness and incorrect product offerings. In general, the aim is to increase knowledge of South African consumers, and improve the predictive power of models, as well as boost compliance.

                     <h3>Machine learning to predict Churn</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Churn is defined as the percentage of customers who moved to a different service provider within a given time period. It is a particular feature of the telecommunications industry that is of concern to service providers, as it has profound impact on income and profitability. 
                        <br><br>   
                        A Cogitait client in the telecoms sector saw considerable potential in leveraging their warehoused data to manage voluntary churn. Initially, the project aimed to discover and examine the patterns of behaviour associated with churn. The Cogitait data scientists used weights of evidence, logistic regression and random forests to predict customers that were highly likely to churn, and in conjunction with an expert-based approach, alerts were triggered to highlight particular accounts. These accounts were forwarded into a retention queue for proactive attempts to retain them.
                        
                     </p>
                     <h4>Spend prediction</h4>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        The machine learning techniques employed by the Cogitait team not only helped to manage voluntary churn, but the improved profiling of customers enables more targeted and relevant product and service offerings in the prepaid customer base especially. This also results in an even better understanding of the customer due to a longer and deeper relationship.
                        <br><br>
                        After profiling customers in new and insightful ways, the project expects to start seeing tangible value from the three selected initial use cases. The next steps will be to increase the sophistication of the modelling and automate the process to a larger extent. 
                     </p>
                     <h3>Cannibalisation in the Telecoms sector</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        The telecommunications industry is a dynamic, competitive and very strategic environment, but is prone to a particular phenomenon. Not only do telecoms companies need to be concerned about competitors’ encroaching on their market share, their very own products may be eating into their profits! This so-called “market cannibalisation” happens when there is a loss in income when the launch of a new product displaces demand for older products. 
                        <br><br>
                        A major listed South African telecoms company, faced exactly this conundrum. They wanted to know how to leverage their extensive data repository to glean insights and make better decisions based on their customers’ profile and financial behaviour, in order to mitigate this situation.

                     </p>   
                     <h3>Data wrangling, analytics, engineering</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        The highly skilled Cogitait team wrangled, analysed and engineered the client’s customer data. Large volumes of sales data were scrutinised, after some significant wrangling. The Cogitait data scientists closely examined trends to gain insights into customers’ spend, reactivation and churn behaviour. The team constructed sophisticated predictive models for campaigning, for client offer targeting specifically. This enables the company to strategically structure product launches in a way that optimises profitability and lessen the impact of market cannibalisation in their telecoms operations. 
                        <br><br>
                        In this ongoing project, the team is actively involved on an operational basis in the execution of campaigns, after which performance tracking and reporting are performed. The Cogitait data scientists have been able to implement many improvements to current systems and have automated a significant proportion of data pipelines.
                        
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                           Client feedback
                        </h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           The CEO of the listed telecoms company had this to say: “The Cogitait team is really easy to work with and it feels like the consultants are alongside my staff, rather than separate from them. This makes it easy to bring together a business need with super-smart data scientists, which is typically where things fall apart.”
                        </p>
                        <h3>Right Party Contact</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           Right party contact is an integral component of strategic business decision-making, necessitated by increasingly difficult business trading conditions and is critical for optimised marketing, customer service and collections efforts.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Customer identity resolution</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           A major South African telecoms company found that its marketing and sales endeavours were hampered by the high velocity in customer contact information changes, particularly within their specific target market. To improve the situation, Cogitait offered guidance on how to combine data assets from across the client company’s subsidiaries to provide a comprehensive corpus of accurate and verifiable customer information. Applying data analytics and artificial intelligence, this project’s core deliverable was a singular, accurate “View of Client”, of which “Right Party Contact” information is the critical element.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                           The client provided Cogitait with data from various internal sources across the group; the information was analysed and used to build an expert model. After examining a variety of attributes, the model was ranked based on recency and frequency logic. Validation on right party contact (RPC) was done by comparing the data to trusted external data sources. Cogitait was able to achieve an average performance of 80% reliability that contact information, indeed, was current and accurate. This is much higher than the industry average.
                           <br><br>
                           The optimised customer contact information will serve as the foundation for a subsequent series of projects aimed at retaining customers, unlocking opportunities and mitigating risk.

                     <h3>Big Data in Healthcare</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Big data is commonly and academically defined to have three significant characteristics: volume, variety and velocity. One of the key industries where generated data adheres to these definitions to a large extent is the healthcare industry. Tellingly, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, big data originating from the health sector was instrumental in developing models used as critical inputs for governments worldwide to devise their response strategy.
                        <br><br>   
                        Even under non-pandemic conditions, the medical industry produces a myriad of health-related data, including electronic health records, scanned imagery, sensor data and financial information. Analysing these types of data allows for a plethora of enhanced services such as disease prediction and prevention, optimised treatment plans, the development of new drugs, telemedicine (remote diagnosis of disease), real-time alerting, insurance fraud detection, as well as human resource and supply chain management,
                     </p>
                     <h4>Health data science</h4>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        However, despite the increasing availability of massive health data sets, even on national and international levels, the complexity of Big Data analysis arises from combining these different information types. Traditional health sector analytics tools have proven incapable to collectively analyse data from electronic healthcare records, pharmaceutical data, clinical trials, patient summaries, genomic data, telemedicine, mobile applications and sensor data, as well as from social media and  information on well-being, behaviour and socio-economic indicators. 
                        <br><br>
                        Health data science is an emerging discipline which combines mathematics, statistics, epidemiology and informatics in order to mitigate these challenges to effectively harness opportunities presented by “Big Data” in healthcare. The Cogitait’ data science team has successfully completed a range of projects within the healthcare sector, ranging from oncology to orthopaedics.

                     <h4>Non-communicable and communicable disease</h4>
                     <p class="text-muted">
                        Advances in Big Data analytics are providing researchers powerful new ways to extract value from diverse sources of data in the fight against cancer in particular, one of the most impactful non-communicable diseases worldwide, especially as the world population grows and ages. Cogitait completed a project for a US client to model, monitor and visualise cancer data in order to recommend optimal treatment regimens. Similarly, the team also modelled orthopaedic data, to predict adverse events related to surgical procedures for patients suffering from dismineral disease. Mental health disorders constitute another related major non-communicable category for which Cogitait is collaborating with a team of neuroscientists as part of an ongoing project. On the infectious disease front, Cogitait has participated in advanced modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic for a major international mining company, as well as building a pipeline to wrangle and visualise tuberculosis patient monitoring data for a US client using data from a large national database consisting of millions of records.

                     <h3>Advanced Analytics for Orthopaedic procedures</h3>
                     <p class="text-muted">Cogitait assisted a US client in the health sector to perform advanced analytics on data pertaining to dismineral disease, orthopaedic procedures and adverse events.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                           The impact of musculoskeletal disorders
                        </h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           In industrialised countries, musculoskeletal disorders pose a significant health and economic burden and account for more than half of all chronic conditions in people age 50 and older. In the United States, almost 6% of GDP is spent annually on healthcare for patients with muscoskeletal diagnoses.
                           In addition, “adverse events” are considered common after orthopaedic procedures. “Adverse events” are defined as any suboptimal outcome experienced by a patient following medical treatment, such as infection, unfavourable reaction to medication, injury and even, death. 
                           However, even in highly industrialised countries, advanced analytics of adverse events surrounding orthopaedic procedures are in their infancy. Despite the increasing availability of national healthcare databases, their complexity cannot be handled effectively by routine analytical methods.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Advanced analytics for orthopaedic procedures</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                           Given their advanced analytics capabilities within the health sector, Cogitait was able to thoroughly investigate the outcomes and risk factors of patients with dismineral diseases undergoing orthopaedic procedures such as hip and knee arthroplasty, as well as spinal fusion.
                        <br><br>
                        The Cogitait data scientist examined millions of data records ranging from 2008 to 2014 from a national database. ICD9 codes were used to filter the data and extract records related to the relevant diseases and orthopaedic procedures.
                        <br><br>
                        SAS software was used to wrangle the colossal dataset into a chart tabulating unique combinations of variable values and their frequency in the dataset. Continuous variables such as length-of-stay and total cost were aggregated. Many cross-tabulations were generated from the frequency table to glean insights and trends from the data.
                        <br><br>
                        The outcome variable of most interest in this project was the incidence of mortality. Among other results, Cogitait was able to pinpoint the precise combinations of demographics, mineral deficiency, and operative procedures that most highly correlated with post-procedural mortality.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                           The benefits and prevalence of Big Data in the healthcare sector are well-known, but it  has been said that Big Data analytics can be considered a potential game-changer in the fight against cancer in particular. Previously, medical researchers had to rely on small sample sizes, case studies and relatively sparse tumour DNA or genetic analyses. 
                           <br><br>
                           In contrast, the current availability of enormous publicly available databases containing a mind-boggling range of data on different types of cancers, across a spectrum of demographics, regions and genetic profiles, have rendered traditional analytics tools defunct. The advanced computer modelling and wrangling provided by data scientists make it possible to construct better predictive models for improved diagnosis and tailor-made treatment.

                        <p class="text-muted">
                           In this project, oncological data was extracted from a large, publicly available, all-payer, inpatient healthcare database designed to produce regional and national estimates of inpatient utilisation, access, charges, quality, and outcomes for the United States.
                           <br><br>
                           The oncological data modelling determined which outcome was most probable in patients (based on their attributes) with breast cancer and what route of intervention to follow based on the result. For example, this aided oncologists in deciding whether to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy or perform invasive surgery on the patient before administering chemo.
                           <br><br>
                           This study also interrogated the possibility of predicting the downstaging of a tumour and the level of lymphovascular invasion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

                        The Recommender Model analyses purchasing behaviour of customers, as well as how products are purchased. Through this behavioural analysis, clusters of products are matched with clusters of customers where the clusters are not mutually exclusive.
                        <br><br>
                        Working with one of the largest quick service restaurant companies in the world, customers are assigned a weight to each behaviour type (cluster) which was defined by buying a set of products in specific ratios. In this way, the recommender not only provided a ranked list of all products fed to it for every customer regardless of if they have purchased it before, but also showed insights on purchase behaviour through the clusters. For example, what items are frequently ordered together.

                              Fintech is shorthand for “financial technology” and, at its
                              inception at the turn of the millennium, initially referred
                              to improvements in back-end data storage and processing
                              technology. However, Fintech has since evolved to include
                              advanced software and algorithms that leverage big data to
                              benefit financial services providers and their
                              customers.Cogitait has successfully concluded a variety of
                              financial services projects, risk modelling in particular,
                              which include developing an online decision science
                              platform. Our expertise in alternative variable creation,
                              extensive data engineering and highly sophisticated
                              modelling techniques have also resulted in groundbreaking
                              methodologies within both the consumer and commercial
                              lending spheres, as well as algorithmic trading.

                           <p>
                              The financial services industry has always been at the
                              forefront of generating Big Data, i.e. data characterised by
                              its large volume, variety and velocity. A lot of traditional
                              financial services data is structured and automatically
                              generated but can also be unstructured where there was human
                              intervention, for example, contact ability or employment
                              data. In the highly regulated finance industry, predictive
                              models can be assessed on predictive strength and need to be
                              transparent and stable. These well-known techniques are then
                              easily transferred to other datasets. For example, it
                              becomes easy to understand logistic regression with weights
                              of evidence transformation.

                              Advanced data wrangling, modelling, and engineering have
                              significantly improved risk assessment, whether in existing
                              credit markets or in market segments where traditional
                              credit profiles are lacking. The use of alternative data has
                              bolstered credit risk profiling for customers with existing
                              credit profiles and has enabled credit scoring for those who
                              have no, or very thin, credit history. This has led to an
                              outburst of innovation in emerging markets, particularly
                              where there is a lack of robust credit registries.
