                                        Fintech is shorthand for “financial technology” and, at its inception at the turn of the millennium, initially referred to improvements in back-end data storage and processing technology. However,
                                        Fintech has since evolved to include advanced software and algorithms that leverage big data to benefit financial services providers and their customers.Cogitait has successfully concluded a variety
                                        of financial services projects, risk modelling in particular, which include developing an online decision science platform. Our expertise in alternative variable creation, extensive data engineering
                                        and highly sophisticated modelling techniques have also resulted in groundbreaking methodologies within both the consumer and commercial lending spheres, as well as algorithmic trading.

                                        Fintech allows newcomers in the financial services sector to challenge traditional financial operations by offering more flexibility, better and faster services, as well as servicing underserved
                                        segments of the customer population. In addition, Fintech includes emerging blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin. Fintech enables conventional financial services providers to improve their product
                                        offerings, and hence, profitability. Industry trends include increased financial inclusion in the unbanked, developing context, where alternative data (like cellphone use) and gamification are being
                                        used to derive credit scores for the unbanked segment, especially in developing economies.

                                        The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of generating Big Data, i.e. data characterised by its large volume, variety and velocity. A lot of traditional financial services data
                                        is structured and automatically generated but can also be unstructured where there was human intervention, for example, contact ability or employment data. In the highly regulated finance industry,
                                        predictive models can be assessed on predictive strength and need to be transparent and stable. These well-known techniques are then easily transferred to other datasets. For example, it becomes easy
                                        to understand logistic regression with weights of evidence transformation.

                                        Advanced data wrangling, modelling, and engineering have significantly improved risk assessment, whether in existing credit markets or in market segments where traditional credit profiles are lacking.
                                        The use of alternative data has bolstered credit risk profiling for customers with existing credit profiles and has enabled credit scoring for those who have no, or very thin, credit history. This has
                                        led to an outburst of innovation in emerging markets, particularly where there is a lack of robust credit registries.

                                        From predictive analytics to machine learning, the application of data science within the healthcare industry is vast. The health sector generates a plethora of data, the efficient analysis of which
                                        opens up opportunities for innovative ways to prevent, treat and cure disease, improving the lives of humans.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Health data science is an emerging discipline that combines mathematics, statistics, epidemiology and informatics to mitigate these challenges and effectively harness opportunities presented by Big
                                        Data in healthcare. Cogitait has successfully completed a variety of projects in the medical field, from oncology to orthopaedics, epidemiological to business case modelling, as well as both burn-out
                                        and resilience prediction.

                                        Advances in Big Data analytics are providing researchers with powerful new ways to extract value from diverse data sources in the fight against cancer, particularly one of the most impactful
                                        non-communicable diseases worldwide, especially as the world population grows and ages. Cogitait completed a project for a US client to model, monitor and visualise cancer data to recommend optimal
                                        treatment regimens. Similarly, the team modelled orthopaedic data to predict adverse events related to surgical procedures for patients suffering from mineral bone disease.<br />

                                                    Traditionally, when assessing a potential customer’s credit risk, financial services providers have had to rely on information pertaining to the individual’s past credit activities, such

                                                    competitors’ encroaching on their market share, their very own products may be eating into their profits! This so-called “market cannibalisation” happens when there is a loss in income
                                                    when the launch of a new product displaces demand for older products.

                                                    based on their customers’ profile and financial behaviour, in order to mitigate this situation.

                                                        but also showed insights on purchase behaviour through the clusters. For example, what items are frequently ordered together.

                                    <h4>Empowering financial services</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Fintech is shorthand for “financial technology” and, at its inception at the turn of the millennium, initially referred to improvements in back-end data storage and processing technology. However,
                                        Fintech has since evolved to include advanced software and algorithms that leverage big data to benefit financial services providers and their customers.Cogitait has successfully concluded a variety
                                        of financial services projects, risk modelling in particular, which include developing an online decision science platform. Our expertise in alternative variable creation, extensive data engineering
                                        and highly sophisticated modelling techniques have also resulted in groundbreaking methodologies within both the consumer and commercial lending spheres, as well as algorithmic trading.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Disruptive technology</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Fintech allows newcomers in the financial services sector to challenge traditional financial operations by offering more flexibility, better and faster services, as well as servicing underserved
                                        segments of the customer population. In addition, Fintech includes emerging blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin. Fintech enables conventional financial services providers to improve their product
                                        offerings, and hence, profitability. Industry trends include increased financial inclusion in the unbanked, developing context, where alternative data (like cellphone use) and gamification are being
                                        used to derive credit scores for the unbanked segment, especially in developing economies.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Big data and machine learning</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of generating Big Data, i.e. data characterised by its large volume, variety and velocity. A lot of traditional financial services data
                                        is structured and automatically generated but can also be unstructured where there was human intervention, for example, contact ability or employment data. In the highly regulated finance industry,
                                        predictive models can be assessed on predictive strength and need to be transparent and stable. These well-known techniques are then easily transferred to other datasets. For example, it becomes easy
                                        to understand logistic regression with weights of evidence transformation.
